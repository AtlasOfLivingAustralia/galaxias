Description: The Darwin Core data standard is widely used to share 
  biodiversity information, most notably by the Global Biodiversity Information 
  Facility and its partner nodes; but converting data to this standard can be 
  tricky. 'galaxias' is functionally similar to 'devtools', but with a focus on 
  building Darwin Core Archives rather than R packages, enabling data to be 
  shared and re-used with relative ease. For details see 
  Wieczorek and colleagues (2012) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0029715>.
