Description: galaxias helps users describe, package and share biodiversity 
  information using the 'Darwin Core' data standard, which is the format used
  and accepted by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and it's
  partner nodes. It is functionally similar to `devtools`, but with a focus on
  building Darwin Core Archives (DwCA's) rather than R packages.
