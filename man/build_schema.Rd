\usage{
build_schema(source = "data", destination = "./data/meta.xml")
}
\arguments{
\item{source}{A directory (\strong{not} a file) containing files to be documented
in the schema document. Defaults to the \code{data} folder within the current
working directory. Note that files that do not match the Darwin Core naming
convention and/or do not end in \code{.csv} are ignored.}

\item{destination}{A file name for the resulting schema document. Defaults
to \code{./data/meta.xml} for consistency with the Darwin Core standard.}
}
\value{
Does not return an object to the workspace; called for the side
effect of building a file named \code{meta.xml} in the specified directory.
}
\description{
A schema is an xml document that maps the files and field names in a DwCA.
It works by detecting column names on csv files in a specified directory;
these should all be Darwin Core terms for this function to produce reliable
results.
