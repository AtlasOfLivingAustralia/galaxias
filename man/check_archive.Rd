\usage{
check_archive(x = "data")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(string) A directory containing the files to be published, or

Defaults to the \code{data} folder within the current working directory.}
}

results; but primarily called for the side-effect of generating a report in
the console.
}
\description{
This is a wrapper to two other packages; schema and EML files (i.e. xml) are
checked with the \code{paperbark} package; csv files are checked with the \code{corella}
package.
}
\seealso{
\code{validate_archive()} which runs checks via API, rather than locally.
