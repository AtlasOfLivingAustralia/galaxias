<h2>Create Darwin-Core Archives in R</h2>

This package is intended to support data submission to biodiversity data
infrastructures such as the [ALA](https://www.ala.org.au) and 
[GBIF](https://gbif.org), by providing the following features:

 - auto-detect field headings and data types (`{janitor}`, `{lubridate}` etc) IN PROGRESS
 - provide metadata in `.md` format, tools for converting to and from `xml` IN PROGRESS
 - (optionally) manually re-assign column headings for unrecognised fields
 - ask sensible questions to fill unavailable columns (e.g. spatial resolution, unique record identifier)
 - generate (and optionally submit) a Darwin Core Archive
 - optionally output revised objects in standard formats (`.csv`, `.md`)
 - run the above using functions in R or via `{shiny}`
 
This package is currently under active development.

``` r
# Install the development version of this package:
library(remotes)
install_github("atlasoflivingaustralia/galaxias")

# Load package
library(galaxias)
```

## What is Darwin Core?
The 'Darwin Core' format is the data format used by GBIF and it's node 
member organisations. It stores observations of plants and animals 
('occurrences') in a standardised manner to facilitate sharing and re-use. It is 
maintained by the Biodiversity Information Standards group 
(https://www.tdwg.org).

A Darwin Core archive contains three files:

- `data.csv`: A dataset containing one occurrence per row, using standardised 
  column names
- `eml.xml`: A metadata file containing information about the provider, and how
  the data were collected
- `meta.xml`: A file describing mapping each column name in `data.csv` to a 
  corresponding name from the Darwin Core standard
  
These components are placed inside a zip file, which is then known as a Darwin 
Core 'Archive' (DwC-A).

## What does `galaxias` do?
This package is designed to help people who have made field-based biological 
observations to submit those observations to the ALA. It does this by providing:

- Simple tools for checking column names, and converting them to 
  Darwin Core standards
- Boilerplate text for what metadata is required with your submission, and
  converting it to the required format
- Functions for zipping these derived files into a DwC-A

Our intention is to make the process of submitting data to ALA as quick and 
seamless as possible, without requiring the user to master lots of complex
functions, and without requiring an in-depth knowledge of the data structures
used by ALA and GBIF.

## Example workflow

First we import data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
x <- read_csv("a_file.csv")
```

We can then check this data using `galaxias`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(galaxias)
y <- detect_dwc_columns(x)
# Q: should we add reporting loop in here?
```

Once you are happy with how your data is formatted, you need to start on 
metadata:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(purrr)

# Opens metadata template interactively in RStudio for you to edit
# By default, this function copies the template to the root of your project directory
# Feel free to move this file to where you see fit
edit_metadata_md()

# Read completed template back into R
# Specify the path to the metadata template file
# For purpose of demo, will read example md
md_template <- read_metadata_md("inst/markdown/westerband_template.md")

# Convert md_text into tibble
md_tibble <- md_to_tibble(md_template)

# Convert tibble into list
# This step preps the metadata text so that 
# it can easily interact with the XML template 
md_list <- md_tibble_to_list(md_tibble)

# Retrieve blank eml list structure (stored internally in package)
eml_template_list 
str(eml_template_list)

# Update fields in eml_template_list
# Currently implemented for Title and Name only
eml_template_updated <- 
  update_title(eml_template_list, md_list)|> 
  update_names(md_list) 

# Preview updated changes
eml_template_updated |> pluck("eml", "dataset", "title")
eml_template_updated |> pluck("eml", "dataset", "contact")
```

Finally, we run ..., which builds the `meta.xml` file and packages the archive:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# In progress currently implemented for the occurrence data only
make_core_xml(file_name = "DwC_occurrence.csv")
```
