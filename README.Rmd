## Overview

`galaxias` is an R package that helps users describe, package and share 
biodiversity information using the ['Darwin Core'](https://dwc.tdwg.org) data 
standard. It was created by the 
[Science & Decision Support Team](https://labs.ala.org.au) at the 
[Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au) (ALA).

The package is named for a genus of freshwater fish that is found only in the 
Southern Hemisphere, and predominantly in Australia and New Zealand. The logo 
shows a 
[Spotted Galaxias](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/e4d85845-3e34-4112-90a9-f954176721ec) 
(_Galaxias truttaceus_) drawn by Ian Brennan.

   and data-processing scripts using `galaxias_project()`.
 - Create documents to describe the origin and structure of your data using
   `build_metadata()` and `build_schema()`.
 - Zip up your data for sharing or publication using `build_archive()`.
 - Check data for consistency with the Darwin Core standard, either locally 
   using `check_archive()`, or via API using `validate_archive()`.

the Darwin Core standard. The other packages are:
